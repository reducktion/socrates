## Introduction
>I am a **Citizen of the World**, and my Nationality is Goodwill.

<i>You can now read [a blog post](https://medium.com/@alex.olival/road-to-mastery-building-an-open-source-package-3936f57aed81) about how this package was created and its goals.</i>

**Socrates** is a PHP Package that allows you to validate and retrieve personal data from most [National Identification Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_identification_number) in Europe with the goal of eventually supporting as many countries in the world as possible.
<p>Some countries also encode personal information of the citizen, such as gender or the place of birth. This package allows you to extract that information in a consistent way.</p>
<p>For Laravel, a Facade and request Validator is also made available (see usage below).</p>
<p>This package can be useful for many things, such as validating a user's ID for finance related applications or verifying a user's age without asking for it explicitly. However, we recommend you review your country's data protection laws before storing any information.</p>
<p>Ports of this package to other languages are currently in progress. Check further below for which ones are currently available.</p>

Our goals:
* Standardize and centralise what is usually very difficult and sparse information to find.
* Have a consistent API for retrieving citizen information from an ID, if available.
* Test each individual country validation and data extraction algorithm with a number of valid and invalid IDs.
* Support as many countries as viably possible.

## Installation
`composer require reducktion/socrates`

## Usage
Socrates provides two methods: `validateId` and `getCitizenDataFromId`. Both receive the ID and the country code in [ISO 3166-2 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2)  as the first and second parameters respectively. Simply instantiate the class and call the method you wish:

```php
use Reducktion\Socrates\Socrates;

$socrates = new Socrates();
$socrates->validateId('14349483 0 ZV3', 'PT');
```

For Laravel, a facade is also available for your convenience:

```php
use Reducktion\Socrates\Laravel\Facades\Socrates;

Socrates::getCitizenDataFromId('550309-6447', 'SE');
```

You can also use the `national_id:[COUNTRY CODE]` request validation rule:

```php
$request->validate([
    'id' => 'national_id:lv'
]);
```
Still in Laravel, the package will try to guess the country to be validated by the default locale:

```php
App::setLocale('PT');

Socrates::validateId('11084129 8 ZX8');
```
 
However this is **not** recommended. The safest way is to always explicitly pass the country code as the second parameter.

### validateId
This method will return true or false depending on the validity of the ID.
In case the ID has the wrong character length, an `InvalidLengthException` will be thrown.

```php
if ($socrates->validateId('719102091', 'NL')) {
    echo 'Valid ID.'
} else {
    echo 'Invalid ID.'
}
```

### getCitizenDataFromId
This method will return an instance of `Citizen`. If the ID is invalid, an `InvalidIdException` will be thrown. If the country does not support data extraction, an `UnsupportedOperationException` will be thrown.

```php
$citizen = $socrates->getCitizenDataFromId('3860123012', 'EE');
```

The `Citizen` class stores the extracted citizen data in a consistent format across all countries. It exposes the `getGender()`, `getDateOfBirth()`, `getAge()` and `getPlaceOfBirth()` methods.
All will return a `string` (for the gender and place of birth), `int`(for age), a `Carbon` instance (for the date of birth) or `null` if the value is empty.
<p>Using the example above, Estonia only encodes the date of birth and gender of the citizen in their ID. So the above methods will return:</p>
 
```php
echo $citizen->getGender(); // 'Male'
echo $citizen->getDateOfBirth(); // A Carbon instance with the date '1986-01-23'
echo $citizen->getAge(); // 34 (as of June 2020)
echo $citizen->getPlaceOfBirth(); // null
```

## Supported and Unsupported Countries

[Here](COUNTRIES.md) you can see the full list of supported countries and whether they support data extraction.

Four european countries are currently unsupported: Austria 🇦🇹, Belarus 🇧🇾, Cyprus 🇨🇾 and Germany 🇩🇪. This is because we could not find a reliable source for the algorithm, if at all. Help would be appreciated to get these countries supported.

## Testing
`composer test`

## Ports
This package is also available for the following languages:

[Rust](https://github.com/reducktion/socrates-rs)

## Contributing

Did you find a problem in any of the algorithms? 
Do you know how to implement a country which we have missed?
Are there any improvements that you think should be made to the codebase?
Any help is appreciated! Take a look at our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Credits
Socrates was made with 💖 by [Alexandre Olival](https://github.com/AlexOlival)  and [João Cruz](https://github.com/JoaoFSCruz). 
We are Reducktion.
We hope to make someone's life easier after all the hard work compiling, researching, reverse-engineering and agonizing over ID validation algorithms - many of which were very obscure and hard to find.

## Special thanks
A big thanks goes to these people who helped us either test with real life IDs or guide us in finding the algorithm for their countries:
* Alexandra from 🇷🇴
* Berilay from 🇹🇷
* Christian from 🇨🇭
* Domynikas from 🇱🇹
* Jeppe from 🇩🇰
* Jeremy from 🇫🇷 
* Lisa from 🇬🇷
* Miguel from 🇪🇸

and Nair from 🇵🇹 for the package name.
